# World Cup 2019
An Android application of the World Cup 2019 Cricket Tournament!<br><br>
During the Internship as a Software Developer at [KPSOFTWARESOLUTIONS](https://kpsoftwaresolutions.org/) I developed this Amazing Android project.<br>
This project is my first project that was published on PlayStore.ðŸ˜‡<br>
I used **Firebase Database** in this application to update the point table.<br>
I put some unique features on this project to make it different from any other project.<br>
<br>You can find this project on PlayStore.<br>

1. History of all the previous tournaments with visualization.<br>

3. List of all qualified teams for the upcoming tournament.<br>
4. Details of each team with the phone of each player.<br>
5. Dynamic Point table.
